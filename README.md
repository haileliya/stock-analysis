Title: Written Analysis of Results

Overview of the project
  
  The purpose of this project was to use VBA, a prograaming langued used by excel to analyze by running a set of commands that is applicable for multiple data sets. The results of this analysis would essentially bused to make data driven decisions related to diversifying a client's stock. This analysis will allow the client  to make the best decision to grow their money by investing in the right industry.

  Challenges
    
    To be honest, this challenge was very difficult for me and I did not complete the challenge according to the requirements. Although I was able to get the correct output, I was using a code that I learned throughout the module because I was unable to run the refractored script. Therefore, I was unable to find the difference between the original script run time and the modified one. Nevertheless, I was still able to compare the Return outputs.
   
  Comparing 2017 & 2018 results
    
    Overall, 2017 showed to have greater return in each market compared to 2018, in which 9 out of the 11 portofolios were in the negatives. In 2017, only one portfolio had a negative return (-7.2%), while the highest return was seen by DAQO (199.4%). Additionally, ENPH and RUN were the two portfolios that had a positive return in both 2017 and 2018. The analysis showed a postive upward trend in percentage return, potentially making it a worthy stock to invest in. 
    
Summary
    
  What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
    The main advantage of refractoring code is that it cuts down on the analysis time and allows for consistency across multiple data sets. This also allows users to maintain one core code that can be cleaned and organized. The only disadvantage I believe this has is that it may create confusion if the code is not properly labeled with comments/notes. 
  
  How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
     Althought I was unable to compare the run time for the original and refractored codes, I assume that the refractored code run time was shorter than the original.
